[//]: # (![GitHub Workflow Status]&#40;https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/LuckyMcBeast/kotmock/tests?label=tests&#41;)
#### A simple mocking library for Kotlin/Native and Kotlin/JVM with the goal of being Native-first with no dependencies other than Kotlin itself.

### Why KotMock?

Though Kotlin does have existing mocking libraries, the two biggest being Mockito-Kotlin and MockK, however, those libraries are not compatible with Kotlin/Native and are also quite heavy. Other small libaries for mocking in Kotlin/Native exist as well, however, all of these libraries require Kotlin Symbol Processing API provided by Google, adding an extra dependency to your project. KotMock requires no dependencies aside from Kotlin, is easy to use, and has an intentionally small codebase.

### Documentation is coming soon.
